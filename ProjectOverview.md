# Project Overview
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

## Suggested App Ideas
- Details about a small business in your neighborhood
- Contact info and description about your workplace or school
- Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) you’re part of and how new members can sign up

##Requirements
Your design must include:
- Business name
- At least one photo representing the business
- Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
    - Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
    - Address of the Business
    - Description of business
    - Hours of operation

Note: This is **not** required but If you’re up for a making real impact in your community, go check out an actual local business and obtain their consent to build an app for them!
